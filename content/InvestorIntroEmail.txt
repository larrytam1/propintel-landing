Subject: Quick intro — PropIntel (AI underwriting for real estate investors)

Hi <Name>,

I’m building PropIntel — an AI-native underwriting assistant that instantly scores properties (as-is value, ARV, rent, ROI), flags motivated sellers, and exports an investor-ready deal sheet in one click.

Why now? I’m a real estate investor and kept hitting the same walls: hours lost underwriting, fragmented data, unreliable rent comps, and guessing at motivated sellers. PropIntel automates those headaches.

We’re opening early access and piloting in 1–2 metros. I’d value your take, and if it’s interesting, I can send a 10-slide deck and quick demo.

Deck & 1-pager: attached

Thanks for your time,
